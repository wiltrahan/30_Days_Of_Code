# DAY 25 Running Time and Complexity



## Task 
A *prime* is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Given a number, *n*, 
determine and print whether it's *Prime* or *Not Prime*.

### Input Format
The first line contains an integer, *T*, the number of test cases.   
Each of the *T* subsequent lines contains an integer, *n*, to be tested for primality.

### Output Format
For each test case, print whether *n* is *Prime* or *Not Prime* on a new line.

### Sample Input
3  
12  
5  
7  

### Sample Output
Not prime  
Prime  
Prime
