# DAY 29: Bitwise AND

## Task 
Given set *S = {1, 2, 3, ..., N}*. Find two integers, *A* and *B* (where *A < B*), from set *S* such that the value of *A&B* is the 
maximum possible and also less than a given integer, *K*. In this case, *&* 
represents the bitwise *AND* operator.

### Input Format
The first line contains an integer, *T*, the number of test cases. 
Each of the *T* subsequent lines defines a test case as *2* space-separated integers, *N* and *K*, respectively.

### Output Format
For each test case, print the maximum possible value of *A&B* on a new line.

### Sample Input
